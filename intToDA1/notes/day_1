First install and setup Anaconda. 
Finishes the Anaconda/Jupitar mini-course, to for then, return the original course.

The original course requires python 2.7, but I'll install conda 3 (python 3),
so, if something goes wrong, try to remember that and adapt the code.

Anaconda3 will now be installed into this location:
/home/username/anaconda3

I'll install the required packages, for the course of DA 
(numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn)

To uninstall, use conda remove package_name.
To update, conda update package_name, or update all, conda update --all.
To search for a package, conda search *search_term*.

I stopped in managing environments, because I have to see set later 
the proveided environment.

# Correction - every time that I start a terminal, conda (base) is initialized.
so I try:
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
