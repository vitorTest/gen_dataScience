I create an exampe, but remeber to set the real environment after! 
# conda create -n -env_name- -list of packages-
For real I created:
# conda create -n frst_tst_del numpy

With a specific python 
#  conda create -n py3 python=3
# => or py2 python=2
# => or to a specific version:  conda create -n py python=3.3

Once you have an environment created, use 'conda activate my_env' to enter it.
You can check installed packages, with 'conda list'.
To leave the environment, type source deactivate.

A really useful feature is sharing environments so others can install all the
packages used in your code, with the correct versions. 
You can save the packages to a YAML file with
conda env export > environment.yaml
This file can now be shared and others will be able to create the same 
environment you used for the project.

IMPORTANT:
To create an environment from an environment file use 
conda env create -f environment.yaml

Use 'conda env list' to list out all the environments you've created. 
'conda env remove -n env_name' will remove the specified environment.
